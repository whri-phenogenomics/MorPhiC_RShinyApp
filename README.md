# MorPhiC Gene List Selection and Exploration Tool

This tool provides an interactive platform to explore and analyze gene-level annotations for all protein-coding genes. It offers insights into genetic functions, diseases, and knockout information.

## Features

- **Gene Annotations**:
  - Mouse knockouts
  - Human disease associations
  - hPSC knockouts (human pluripotent stem cells)
  - Gene constraint metrics
  - Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  - Reactome pathways
  - Protein-protein interactions
  - Gene expression data

- **Planned Null Allele Generation**:
  - Displays the genes planned for null allele generation from each of the four Data Production Centers:
    - JAX (The Jackson Laboratory)
    - NWU (Northwestern University)
    - UCSF (University of California, San Francisco)
    - MSK (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center)

- **Enrichment Analysis**:
  - Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  - Reactome pathways
  - Lethal mouse knockouts
  - Disease genes
  - Essential genes
